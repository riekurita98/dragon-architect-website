                           Dragon Architect is an educational game, written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, created at the University of Washington. It was used to investigate key open problems in the design of games that teach computational thinking skills (strategies that are used in computer science). To teach these concepts, Dragon architect uses block base programming which allows students to drag and drop blocks to create a program to move a dragon around a virtual world and build things.
                           <span id="moreOverview"><br><br>
                           Games like Dragon Architect can actually increase representation in computer science. Research has shown that many students, especially non-male identifying, lack confidence that they have the ability to learn computer science, which can prevent them from ever trying. By playing educational games, students are able to build confidence in their own skills. Playing a game can also change a student’s perspective on the field of computer science in general. For example, computer science is perceived as a field more appropriate for men, discouraging non-male identifying students from participating, but a game that is specifically created to appeal to all genders can help change that misconception. Finally, a game like Dragon Architect can increase overall interest in computer science. One hope for a game like Dragon Architect is to provide students an opportunity to discover their interest in computer science. 
                           <br><br>
                           The original game was created for middle school students. Our project was to redesign the game for college students, specifically students who have never learned computer science or who are just starting out. 
                           <br><br>
                           We transformed the front end to be a modern and engaging user experience. We also added a Python display, representing the block code, to better connect Dragon Architect with the Carleton Intro Computer Science course. The original game taught students about loops and functions; our final major addition to the game was adding four new levels to teach variables.

                  To evaluate whether the changes we made to the game accomplished our goals of altering the game to make it effective for use with a college student population, we conducted a formal user study. Our user study had a single-group pretest-posttest design, which means that each participant is tested twice, once before and once after a treatment. In our case, this took the form of participants completing a “before” survey, playing the game for 30 minutes, then completing an identical “after” survey.
                  <span id="moreResult"><br><br>
                     We recruited 30 Carleton students from class years 2024 through 2020 who had never taken a computer science class and had little to no experience with programming to participate in our study. The surveys that were completed by participants before and after playing were identical, and each participant was only compared to their past self. . They had two sections. The first contained questions that assessed their attitudes towards computer science.
                     <br><br>
                     This section contained 11 Likert-Scale questions that ask participants how much they agree with a given statement about computer science, computing, or computational thinking. Participants are given four possible responses that range from strongly disagree to strongly agree. These questions were drawn from two validated surveys developed by Computer Science Education Researchers. [Hoegh & Moskal, 2009; Cetin & Ozden, 2015]
                     <br><br>
                     The second section of our survey contained four questions that assessed the participants’ understanding of a few computational thinking skills, including loops, variables, and procedures.
                     These questions present a snippet of python code, shown on the left, and asked the participant to choose the image that displays what the cubes and dragon would look like after the code is run.

                     The second section of our survey contained four questions that assessed the participants’ understanding of a few computational thinking skills, including loops, variables, and procedures.
                     <br><br>
                     These questions present a snippet of python code, shown on the left, and asked the participant to choose the image that displays what the cubes and dragon would look like after the code is run. This question in particular was assessing understanding of nested loops and variables.
                     <br><br>
                     To analyze any change in the participants’ attitudes towards CS, we calculated an average attitude score for each student from before and after playing the game. We did so by turning their responses into integer values, flipping the scale for statements that were negative towards computer science, then averaging across the 11 questions. For example, a response of “strongly disagree” to a positive statement about computer science was coded as 0 while a “strongly agree” response to a positive statement about computer science was coded as 3. Therefore, possible attitude scores ranged from 0 to 3, with 3 indicating positive attitudes towards computer science. 
                     <br><br>
                     Before playing the game, participants had an average attitude score of 1.4, and you can see the distribution in scores in this histogram. After playing the game, participants had an average attitude score of 1.8, and you can see the distribution in “after” scores in the histogram on the right. A t-test of dependent means revealed that this is a significant difference in attitude score from before to after playing. The effect size related to this change is 1.3, so we can conclude that this effect is also large. 
                     <br><br>
                     Overall, these are exciting preliminary results that suggest that our updated version of the game effectively introduces Carleton students to computational thinking and improves Carleton students’ attitudes towards Computer Science.
